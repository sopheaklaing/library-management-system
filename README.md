# React + Vite
# Library Management System
## Team Project Contribution
This project was developed as a **team project**.  
My main responsibility was the **frontend development**.

### My Contributions
- Designed and implemented the user interface using React
- Created pages for Admin, Staff, and Student
- Built responsive layouts and components
- Connected frontend pages with backend APIs
- Improved user experience and navigation

This is a web-based **Library Management System** built with **React and Vite**.  
The system allows **students, staff, and administrators** to manage library activities through different user pages.

## Features
- Separate pages for:
  - Admin
  - Staff
  - Student
- User authentication
- Book management
- Borrow and return system
- Admin dashboard
- CRUD operations for books and users
- Fast and responsive interface using React

## Tech Stack

### Database

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
